# Present Zone

## Overview
The **Present Zone** reflects the modern world, with bustling cityscapes, towering skyscrapers, and chaotic streets. However, after the Temporal Fracture, parts of the city have begun to warp, with fragments of other times appearing sporadically.

## Story
In the aftermath of the Temporal Fracture, the **Present Zone** has become a chaotic reflection of modern life. Time glitches cause moments to freeze, buildings to shift, and people to disappear into echoes of their former selves. Timea or Tempus must navigate the challenges of the modern era, solving puzzles based on shifting environments and collecting Chrono Crystals hidden in this bustling landscape.

## Key Locations:
- **City Central**: A dense urban area where time warps cause traffic to freeze and buildings to shift unexpectedly.
- **The Subway Labyrinth**: An underground network of tunnels where trains from different eras pass through, making navigation perilous.
- **Corporate Tower**: A high-tech skyscraper housing a secretive company that may have knowledge of the Great Time Clock.
