# Chrono Climbers

## Overview
**Chrono Climbers** is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where time is not linear but can be climbed and descended like a landscape. Players can choose to take on the role of either **Timea** or **Tempus**, skilled adventurers with the ability to jump through time zones and manipulate time. The goal is to collect **Chrono Crystals** needed to repair the **Great Time Clock**, restoring balance to the world.

## Story
In the small village of **Ticktock**, the inhabitants discover that time is in danger. The **Great Time Clock**, responsible for synchronizing all time zones, has been damaged, causing time to fall apart and throwing different time zones out of balance. Timea (female) or Tempus (male), gifted with the ability to manipulate time, must travel through these zones and collect the Chrono Crystals needed to repair the clock and save the world.

## Gameplay
### Key Features:
- Choose between **Timea** or **Tempus**, each capable of time-based maneuvers to solve unique puzzles:
  - **Time Jump**: Allows the character to move backward in short bursts to undo recent actions or avoid obstacles. After using a Time Jump, players can **restore** the original timeline, returning to where they were before the rewind if they don’t like the new outcome.
  - **Time Slow**: Slows down the flow of time around the character, useful for navigating fast-moving platforms or enemies.
- The game is divided into different zones, each with its own time theme:
  - **Past Zone**: Explore historical environments like medieval castles or prehistoric landscapes.
  - **Present Zone**: Modern cityscapes with contemporary challenges such as busy traffic or towering skyscrapers.
  - **Future Zone**: Futuristic settings with advanced technology and AI-controlled enemies.

  Additional story and lore for each zone can be found in their respective README files.

### Objectives:
Players must solve puzzles and defeat enemies to collect **Chrono Crystals**. Each level has a time limit, which can be influenced by the character’s abilities. By completing levels quickly or taking on extra challenges, players can earn **time medals** that unlock upgrades and new zones.

## Graphics and Sound
- The game combines pixel art with modern lighting effects and animations that reflect the theme of each zone.
- The transition between zones features visual shifts in time, such as fading colors from past to future.
- Each zone has its own unique musical theme, with sound effects that change based on time manipulation.
