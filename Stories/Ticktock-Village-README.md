# Ticktock Village

## Overview
**Ticktock** is a mysterious village situated in no particular timezone, existing in a temporal anomaly where the past, present, and future all converge. The village has always been a hub for travelers, scholars, and timekeepers, who study the nature of time and its impact on the world.

## Story
The village of Ticktock once flourished as a neutral ground where timekeepers from different eras gathered to maintain the **Great Time Clock**, a device capable of synchronizing all time zones. However, the clock was damaged in a cataclysmic event known as the **Temporal Fracture**, causing time to break and scatter into disconnected zones.

Now, with time thrown into disarray, the villagers have entrusted their hope in a chosen adventurer, either Timea or Tempus, to travel through the broken time zones and collect the **Chrono Crystals** needed to repair the clock and restore balance to their world.

The village itself is caught between momentsâ€”time moves slower here, giving it an eternal quality. Buildings reflect all times, with a mixture of ancient architecture, modern constructions, and futuristic technology blending into a seamless whole.

## Key Locations:
- **The Chrono Tower**: The central building of Ticktock, where the Great Time Clock is housed.
- **Timekeeper's Guild**: An institution where scholars study time and maintain the delicate balance.
- **Village Square**: A meeting place where adventurers from different times gather to share stories and trade goods.
