# Past Zone

## Overview
The **Past Zone** is a rugged, time-worn land, scattered with the remnants of forgotten civilizations. Time fractures have left eras overlapping in unpredictable ways, with primitive landscapes coexisting alongside ancient ruins and medieval fortresses. This zone is a perilous mix of different time periods, where prehistoric creatures roam beside armored knights, and ancient machines hum with mysterious energy.

The Past Zone holds fragments of a lost civilization known as the **Chronarchs**—guardians of time who once possessed profound knowledge of temporal control. Their structures, hidden throughout the zone, are both a source of wisdom and a danger for any traveler.

## Story
Following the Temporal Fracture, the Past Zone was transformed into a chaotic land where time periods are entangled, creating a volatile environment. Timea or Tempus must navigate these treacherous lands to locate and collect **Chrono Crystals** buried within. As they progress, they uncover ancient inscriptions and artifacts that reveal glimpses into the world of the Chronarchs—a once-great civilization who sought to master time itself.

Their ruins, brimming with puzzles and traps, hold keys to unlocking the knowledge needed to repair the **Great Time Clock**. However, danger lies in every corner, as natural and man-made threats challenge the adventurer’s skills and courage.

## Key Locations
- **The Ruins of Chrona**:
  The **Ruins of Chrona** are the heart of the Chronarch civilization, a once-thriving city built with advanced understanding of time. Now overgrown and partially buried, these ruins house complex time-based puzzles and traps, left to protect the Chronarchs' secrets from intruders. Throughout Chrona, giant sundials, ancient time dials, and echoing inscriptions hint at the civilization's knowledge of time manipulation.

  Legends say that deep within the ruins lies the **Eye of Chrona**, an artifact that grants its bearer glimpses into the distant past. If Timea or Tempus can reach this powerful relic, they may gain insights crucial to restoring the time zones. However, the ruins’ winding pathways are filled with dormant machines and stone guardians that may awaken if disturbed.

- **Dinosaur Valley**:
  This vast, lush valley is where prehistoric creatures such as dinosaurs roam freely, unaware of the time fractures around them. To cross Dinosaur Valley, Timea or Tempus must avoid both the wildlife and the natural traps scattered throughout the terrain—sinkholes, cliffs, and sudden rockfalls make it treacherous to navigate.

  Rumors among the inhabitants of Ticktock suggest that a **Guardian Beast**, an enormous dinosaur, roams the valley. Known as **The Ancient One**, this creature is said to guard a hidden Chrono Crystal. Only those brave enough to face the Ancient One can claim the crystal and continue their quest.

- **The Medieval Citadel**:
  Standing tall on a cliff, the **Medieval Citadel** is a fortress from the age of knights and kings, preserved by a temporal anomaly that keeps its soldiers in an eternal loop of patrols and battles. Armored knights roam the corridors, unaware of the passage of time, endlessly protecting the citadel as if their king still reigns.

  The citadel's labyrinthine corridors are lined with ancient tapestries and murals depicting battles, feasts, and legends of the time. Timea or Tempus must navigate the twists and turns of the citadel while avoiding detection by the patrolling knights. Rumor has it that a grand **Hourglass Chamber** lies at the citadel's core, a place where the Chronarchs once tested their knowledge of time. Those who reach it may unlock hidden powers to assist them in other zones.
