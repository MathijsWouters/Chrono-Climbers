# Present Zone

## Overview
The **Present Zone** is a dynamic reflection of the modern world, filled with bustling cityscapes, towering skyscrapers, and hectic streets. However, following the **Temporal Fracture**, the once familiar landscape has warped into a surreal environment. Fragments of different time periods appear sporadically, leading to bizarre juxtapositions where past, present, and future elements clash.

The Present Zone is both awe-inspiring and unsettling, as time glitches cause objects and people to appear and disappear, leaving echoes of their former selves lingering in space. The zone is filled with technological marvels that occasionally glitch, creating dangerous situations for anyone navigating its streets.

## Story
In the aftermath of the Temporal Fracture, the **Present Zone** has become a chaotic mirror of contemporary life. Timea or Tempus must travel through this altered landscape, collecting **Chrono Crystals** to restore balance and order. Time glitches ripple through the zone, causing moments to freeze unexpectedly, buildings to shift in and out of existence, and people to flicker as mere shadows of their true selves.

The adventurer will face a world where familiarity is warped by unpredictable distortions, forcing them to adapt to new rules and hazards at every turn. Each step forward could reveal a new riddle, a hidden path, or even another era briefly imposed on the Present Zone.

## Key Locations:
- **City Central**:
  The heart of the Present Zone, **City Central** is a dense urban landscape where time warps are most pronounced. Buildings stretch and contract, as though caught in an endless loop of construction and decay. Traffic flows one moment, only to freeze mid-motion the next, leaving cars and pedestrians suspended in eerie stillness. This area is riddled with hidden paths and distorted structures, making it a challenging maze of shifting realities.

  Timea or Tempus must navigate these frozen moments and use their time-manipulating abilities to progress through the ever-changing environment. Each frozen element is a puzzle in itself, requiring careful observation and skill to traverse safely.

- **The Subway Labyrinth**:
  Beneath the city lies the **Subway Labyrinth**, a sprawling network of tunnels where trains from different eras inexplicably pass through. Steam engines, modern subways, and futuristic magnetic levitation trains all share the same tracks, appearing and disappearing as if on a schedule beyond comprehension. The labyrinth is dark, with time fractures causing sudden shifts in the tunnel layout, making it perilous to explore.

  In the Subway Labyrinth, the adventurer must time their movements precisely to avoid being hit by rogue trains from various periods. Some trains may even contain items or clues about the fractured time, rewarding those brave enough to explore their interiors. However, with the time distortions, paths can suddenly close or change, turning a simple commute into a deadly puzzle.

- **Corporate Tower**:
  Rising above the chaotic landscape is the **Corporate Tower**, a high-tech skyscraper owned by a secretive corporation rumored to have knowledge about the Great Time Clock. The building is equipped with advanced security systems that have started to malfunction due to time disruptions. Rooms rearrange, elevators move unpredictably between floors, and robotic guards act erratically, adding to the challenge.

  Timea or Tempus must reach the top of the tower to uncover secrets about the Temporal Fracture and the company's hidden involvement in its cause. Each floor presents new puzzles and enemies, as well as valuable information on time manipulation. The tower also holds data logs that recount the first signs of the Temporal Fracture, possibly pointing toward the reason behind the present-day anomalies.
